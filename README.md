In this project, we developed a **Legal Document AI Assistant** focused on Named Entity Recognition (NER) for extracting key information such as organizations, dates, and persons from legal text. We began by generating and preprocessing synthetic legal documents, tokenizing sentences, and aligning entity labels. Using the **Hugging Face Transformers library**, we fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model for token classification, evaluated its performance with metrics like precision and F1-score, and addressed potential class imbalances in the dataset. We also implemented inference capabilities to extract entities from new legal text and created pathways for deployment via APIs, command-line tools, and user interfaces for real-world use. This end-to-end pipeline can streamline legal document analysis for NetAppâ€™s global clientele.
